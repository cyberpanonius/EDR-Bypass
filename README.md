A compact C loader that proxies exported functions from the Sublime Text application. The loader is designed to load a generated C2 beacon file (e.g., Sliver); you can configure the loader to open the generated beacon. 
It is implemented as a DLL that mimics one of Sublime Textâ€™s DLLs, enabling the application to sideload the loader (DLL side-loading).
The loader may also be adapted for other DLL side-loading scenarios by replacing the exported function stubs and selecting a suitable target binary.
